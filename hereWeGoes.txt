TITLE: “No More Lazy Commits”

Yo, I made a repo, now I'm on a mission,
Killin’ all my slack with clean precision.
No more scrollin', no more sleepin’,
Pushin’ hard while the world be creepin’.

README fire, got my life in code,
Every line I write is beast mode mode.
From lazy to legend, I flipped that switch—
Now ignorance gone with a single git 😤🔥
